He confidedin  the  infamous  courtesan  of  seventeenth-century  France,  Ninon  de  Lenclos,  toinstruct him on how to seduce a difficult young countess. She made him follow a planover  a  number  of  weeks,  where  the  Marquis  would  be  appearing  in  public  alwayssurrounded by beautiful women, in the very places the countess would be expectedto see him. He was supposed to assume an air of nonchalance. This increased thejealousy of the young countess, who was not sure of his interest in her. One day theMarquis,  unable  to  control  his  passion,  broke  from  Ninon’s  plan,  and  blurted  out  tothe  countess  that  he  loved  her.

He publicly stated his praises for the Austrians and talked aboutthe madness of war. Many deputies changed their votes. Had Bismarck announcedhis real intentions, arguing it was better to wait now and fight later, he would not havewon.  Most  Prussians  wanted  to  go  to  war  at  that  moment  and  mistakenly  believedtheir army to be superior to the Austrians. Had he gone to the king his sincerity wouldhave  been  doubted.

Finance  Minister  Fouquet  unintentionally  outshone  his  master,  King  Louis  XIV,  makingthe  King  feel  insecure  by  throwing  a  lavish  party  that  would  show  off  Fouquet’sconnections,  cultivated  manner  and  charm.  Thinking  this  move  would  make  him  anindispensable  asset  to  the  king,  Fouquet  had  actually  offended  his  master  who  did  notlike  the  fact  people  were  more  charmed  by  his  finance  minister  than  by  him.

In order to solvehis perennial  problem of  funding,  he dedicated  his discovery of  the  moons  of Jupiter  tothe Medicis, since the royal symbol of the Medici family was the planet Jupiter. He thencommissioned  an  emblem  for  them,  with  each  moon  representing  one  of  the  sons whorevolved  around  the  patriarch.  The  Medici  family  became  his  major  patron,  appointinghim  their  official  court  mathematician  and  philosopher,  thereby  giving  him  a  morecomfortable life and a steady salary. Wisdom in a nutshell: Present your ideas in such a manner that they may be ascribed to your master, or could be viewed as an echo of your master’s thoughts. If you are more intelligent than your master, act as if you are not. Never take your position for granted. Never let favors you receive go to your head. Discreet flattery is much more powerful. Make it seem like you want to seek his expertise and advice. '}\n",

He spared those who conspired against him, and wasable to win over enemies with his generosity. Do not rely on friends. They will never be totally honest with you. They will not openly disagree with you in order to avoid arguments. Enemies expect nothing so they will be surprised when you are generous. An enemy spared the guillotine will be more grateful to you than a friend. When you decide to hire a friend you will discover qualities she has kept hidden. Skill and competence are more important than friendly feelings. Hiring friends will limit your power. All working situations require a kind of distance between people.

Bismarck knew the Prussian army was not prepared, so he devised a clever way tokeep the war at bay. He publicly stated his praises for the Austrians and talked aboutthe madness of war. Many deputies changed their votes. Had Bismarck announcedhis real intentions, arguing it was better to wait now and fight later, he would not havewon.  Most  Prussians  wanted  to  go  to  war  at  that  moment  and  mistakenly  believedtheir army to be superior to the Austrians. Had he gone to the king his sincerity wouldhave  been  doubted.  By  giving  misleading  statements  about  wanting  peace  andconcealing  his  true  purpose,  Bismarck’s  speech  catapulted  him  to  the  position  ofprime minister. He later led the country to war against the Austrians at the right time,when he felt the Prussian army was more capable. Use decoyed objects of desire and red herrings to throw people off scent. Use smoke screens (a poker face) to disguise your actions. False sincerity is one powerful tool that will send your rivals on a wild goose chase. Publicly declare your false intentions to give misleading signals. A noble gesture can be a smoke screen to hide your true intentions. Blend in and people will be less suspicious. '}\n",

In  1814  Napoleon  wasbanished to a small island called Elba near Italy. Here he was given information that France would embrace him again if he escaped. From Elba he was able to escapeand march back into Paris with a small army. The people bowed to him, and soldierschanged  sides  to  join  him.  The  statesmen  who  had  taken  over  his  empire  fled. Talleyrand watched as his plan unfolded. Napoleon ruled France again for a hundred days,  but  the  country  was  bankrupt  and  could  not  sustain  Napoleon’s  wars  anylonger. Napoleon was recaptured at the Battle of Waterloo and exiled to the barrenisland St. Helena, off the west coast of Africa. This was a much further place with no chance of escape, and was more to Talleyrand’s liking. For  negotiations  and  meetings,  it  is  wise  to  lure  others  into  your  territory,  or  a territory of your choice. Once  someone  suspects  you  are  manipulating  him,  it  will  be  harder  to  control him. Making him come to you gives the illusion he is in control.

For thepublication  of  her  novel Indiana ,  she  assumed  the  pseudonym  George  Sand.  Shedressed in men’s breeches, smoked cigars, and expressed herself in conversation like aman. She even carried on affairs with the most famous artists of Europe - Musset, Liszt,and Chopin - living with freedom and independence unlike any other female writer beforeher. Control your appearances and emotions. Play sincere, but not necessarily be sincere. Create a memorable character. Do not limit yourself to the role society assigns to you. '}\n",

She was able to charm Julius Caesar into restoring her to the throneof Egypt, and playing her siblings against each other. Marc Antony was seduced by her,and  had  her  younger  sister  Arsinoe  executed,  ridding  Cleopatra  of  any  threats  to  herplace as Queen. Wisdom in a nutshell: Conceal your mistakes. Your good name and reputation depends more on what you conceal than on what you reveal. Always have a convenient scapegoat. Never do the dirty work yourself. '}\n",

Emphasize the visual and sensual over the intellectual. Borrow the forms of organized religion to structure the group. Create rituals. Usenames and ranks and titles. Ask them to make sacrifices and give alms. Act like aguru or a prophet. Disguise your source of income. Set up an us-versus-them dynamic.

After yearsof  persecution  by  the  Shuisky  family,  the  poisoning  of  his  mother  Helena,  and  thebanishment of his only friend Vorontsov, the thirteen year-old Ivan invited his rival Prince Andrei Shuisky into his room. No one feared the young boy and the boyars often ridiculedhim. When the guards were suddenly ordered to seize Prince Andrei and execute him, noone  saw  it  coming.  This  one  swift  and  bold  act  secured  Ivan’s  power  for  decades  to come. Ivan initially lay low, showing neither ambition nor discontent. He waited until he had wonover  the  palace  guards  to  his  side.  They  had  come  to  hate  the  cruelty  of  the  Shuiskysover the years, and the time was at hand to strike boldly and swiftly. The bolder the lie, the better. Lions circle the hesitant prey. Boldness strikes fear; Fear creates authority. Going halfway digs the deeper grave. Do not negotiate if you opponent will more likely take the opportunity to destroy you. Hesitation creates gaps. Boldness obliterates them. Move swiftly and surely. Audacity separates you from the herd. '}\n",

MAKE YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS SEEM EFFORTLESS.: Observance of the Law:Sen no Rikyu was an important tea master and adviser on aesthetic and political mattersto the Emperor Hideyoshi. He despised hosts who looked like they were trying to hard. Cha-no-yu,  or  the  Japanese  tea  ceremony,  is  an  art  form,  from  the  preparation  to  theserving;  the  whole  process  must  look  natural  and  easy.  Accidental  grace  and  beautywere  Rikyu’s  specialty.  On  the  night  before  the  Emperor  was  to  visit  him  for  a  teaceremony, he artfully laid cushions in the snow on each stepping-stone to his house. Inthe morning, he removed the cushions revealing the pattern of the stepping-stones like aperfect mold within the snow. This was just  one of Rikyu’s clever aesthetic tricks whichimpressed  the  Emperor,  never  calling  attention  to  the  work  gone  into  it,  but  implying  apolite gesture in itself. What imitates nature by appearing effortless and natural approximates nature’s power. Never show your work until it is finished.

She gave her lovers and suitors three choices, a payeur would pay for her services, butshe would only sleep with him when she liked, a martyr would not have to pay, and be part of her harem of men, and from the martyrs she would choose a favori, or one man to whom she would abandon herself to totally until she was tired of him. The payeurs wereable  to  finance  her  needs  while  she  enjoyed  complete  freedom,  independence,  andvariety from her lovers. She had the equality to men no married woman of the time could possess. Make people your puppets and give them options to let them feel they have control. Force them to choose between the lesser of two evils, both of which serve yourpurpose. Present options but color the one you prefer as the best solution. Force the resister into “choosing” to do what you want by appearing to advocate the opposite. Alter the playing field so the only options available are the ones you offer. Shrinking options force people to buy in now or else the goods won’t be available tomorrow. The weak man must be propelled into action through fear and terror. Involving your victim in your scheme with the threat of their exposure later will keepthem tied to you. They cannot expose you because they will be found out as well.

Observance of the Law:In the 1700s, a mysterious stranger named George Psalmanazar came to fame with hisbooks  and  lectures  on  the  language,  culture  and  history  of  the  island  of  Formosa  (now Taiwan).    After  his  death,  it  was  revealed  that  he  was  in  fact  a  Frenchman  with  a  richimagination who played on the British need for the exotic and strange. He had inventedeverything he had professed to be an expert on, having capitalized on it with best-sellingbooks and having been a favorite guest at many royal dinners. Abraham  Lincoln  created  an  image  of  himself  as  the  homespun  country  lawyer  with  abeard. He played to the fantasy of the common man’s president. People need a fantasy to escape from the humdrum of everyday life. The more vague and exotic, the more captivating.

When dissimilar materials rub or separate it can cause a static charge to build up. The amount of charge depends a lot on the particular materials. One of the materials that is renowned for this is polyester. If you have polyester in your socks, or in your carpeting or rugs, it can be easy to build up a big charge. But polyester isn't the only material prone to this. A classic experiment is to rub a cat with a wool cloth, for example. I used to have a car that caused me to generate a lot of charge when I slid off the seat. I learned to first touch the outside door handle with the palm of my hand instead of my fingertips so that the shock wouldn't feel so intense.\"],\n",

But polyester isn't the only material prone to this. A classic experiment is to rub a cat with a wool cloth, for example.
